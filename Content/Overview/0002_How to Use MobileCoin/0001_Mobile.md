Getting MOB into your MobileCoin app
====================================

The following steps are for US-based users. Users outside of the US can buy MOB directly at [www.buymobilecoin.com](http://www.buymobilecoin.com/).

1\. Buy Bitcoin on a coin exchange
----------------------------------

There are a number of coin exchanges, supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies. Two of the most user-friendly options are FTX and Coinbase.

*To buy Bitcoin on*[ *FTX*](https://ftx.us/)*:*

-   Register and complete the ID verification process to be able to trade on the platform. Detailed steps on registration and the ID verification process are available from[ FTX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am-oCJnZaug).
-   Once verified, log in to FTX and use the Wallet feature to deposit some Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrency) that you can exchange for MOB. For more details on buying cryptocurrencies on FTX, see this[ explainer video](https://youtu.be/8Lnm-ij7Ga4?t=195).

*To buy Bitcoin on*[ *Coinbase*](http://coinbase.com/)*:*

-   Register and complete the ID verification process to be able to trade on the platform. Detailed steps on registration and the ID verification process are available from[ Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-crypto-wallet).
-   Once verified, log in to Coinbase and add a payment method using the green button in the interface. (Coinbase will likely make two small deposits to your bank account, which appear immediately. Login to your bank account and enter the two deposit amounts when prompted.)
-   Once this step is complete, the green button will change and can be used to buy Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies).

2\. Download the[ Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger) app
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mixin Messenger is available on both iOS and Android. Create an account, and set a 6 digit pin. (You'll have to enter it four times.)

3\. Transfer your Bitcoin to your Mixin Messenger wallet
--------------------------------------------------------

Open the Mixin app, and tap the icon on the bottom left to open your wallet.

The default page of the wallet lists cryptocurrencies: find the line for Bitcoin (BTC) which opens the send and receive page. Tap on RECEIVE.

Paste the address (from your Mixin wallet) into the "To" field and tap PREVIEW SEND.

4\. Swap your Bitcoin for MOB in Mixin Wallet
---------------------------------------------

In your Mixin app, tap your initial/profile picture to open the contacts screen. Tap ADD CONTACT*,* enter the number 7000103767, and click SEARCH. This will locate a bot called MixSwap that you can use to convert BTC to MOB. Look for the purple bird logo:

Tapp on *+ *ADD BOT to add it to your app, and you can access it from your main screen in the app or by opening the bot screen.

Open the bot and tap the icon next to the text input field in the bottom. (It looks like a little robot with antennae.)

This will open the exchange screen. Select BTC as the PAY category, and MOB as the RECEIVE category.

![](https://mobilecoinwp.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12.png)

Enter the amount of Bitcoin that you want to trade for MOB.

Note that the MixSwap bot does not tell you how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet. If you forgot, toggle back to your wallet to see the amount.

Once you enter the Bitcoin amount, the corresponding MOB amount will auto-populate.

Tap EXCHANGE --- you now own MobileCoin!
