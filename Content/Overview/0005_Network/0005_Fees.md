title: Transaction Fees
---
Each transaction submitted to the MobileCoin network must pay a fee to the MobileCoin Foundation. The purpose of this fee is to prevent unlimited submission of transactions, which otherwise could be easily abused to degrade users' experience. The [minimum fee per transaction](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/blob/acd72e66832c1aa18dc630bcab610c11978af0dd/transaction/core/src/constants.rs) is 0.0004 MOB, and is always distributed to the following [address](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/blob/master/consensus/enclave/impl/build.rs) (written in hexadecimal format):

`public view key:\

MobileCoin launched with a hard-coded minimum fee of 0.01 MOB. When this constant was set, the value of MobileCoin was assumed to be slightly below 1 USD per coin, resulting in a per-transaction fee of under 0.01 USD (1c). This fee was too high to reasonably support the cannonical use-case---purchasing a cup of coffee---and we lowered the fee to $0.04 to bring it back in line with that use-case. 

There is currently a [proposal](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mcips/pull/1) for the minimum fee to be [configurable](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin/pull/809) in the next version of MobileCoin's protocol. Changing the fee configuration would require a coordinated restart of all validator nodes in the network.
