Decrease the minimum fee to 0.0004 MOB (400uMOB, which is 0.02 USD/tx at a 50 USDMOB exchange rate) per board instruction, allow node operators to override the hard-coded minimum fee, and prevent divergent fees by including fee agreement in the node-to-node attestation / key exchange protocol.

Please see [this document](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mcips/blob/main/text/0001-dynamic-fees-v1.md) for details.
