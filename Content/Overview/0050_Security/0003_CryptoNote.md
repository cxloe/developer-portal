In 2012, Nicolas van Saberhagen, an unknown anonymous author, published the CryptoNote whitepaper describing a new distributed ledger protocol called CryptoNote. At its core, CryptoNote is an attempt to improve on the design of Bitcoin to create an encrypted ledger.

CryptoNote introduced two innovations: ring signatures and one-time addresses. Ring signatures make it harder to statistically analyze the network by changing the direct links between buyers and sellers used in Bitcoin into probabilistic links between sets of possible buyers and sellers. Every transaction has a set of possible ancestors which makes tracking payments in the public ledger much more difficult. 

CryptoNote's one-time addresses allow payments to be received using numerical aliases that are indistinguishable from random numbers for everyone except the intended recipient. Essentially, every transaction in Bitcoin publicly shares the recipient's pseudonymous address, while CryptoNote ledgers publish the recipient's address in an encrypted format that protects user data.
