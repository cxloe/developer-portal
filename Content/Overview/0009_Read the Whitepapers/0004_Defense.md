MobileCoin was built to enable mobile applications like [Signal](https://signal.org/) to send digital payments without compromising on user security. Transactions complete in just a few seconds, and all transaction information is kept encrypted end-to-end between the parties involved.

This article covers our security strategy for building a safe and secure digital currency. We will discuss why decentralization is important, how Bitcoin offers digital gold, and why digital gold is not the digital cash needed for payments. Next, we'll discuss what CryptoNote offers for distributed ledgers, how the MobileCoin ledger further protects users, and how remote attestation can help prove that servers you don't control are running the right software.Â 

MobileCoin's software is composed of 7 defensive layers, each providing increased security:

-   Layer 1: Open-Source
-   Layer 2: Decentralized Governance
-   Layer 3: CryptoNote
-   Layer 4: Confidential Transactions
-   Layer 5: MobileCoin Ledger
-   Layer 6: MobileCoin Consensus Protocol
-   Layer 7: Secure Enclaves and Remote Attestation
